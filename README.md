- 👋 Hi, I’m @uswong.  I am a retired Geophysicist living in Perth, Australia.
- 👀 My home is now quite a smart home with more than 120 smart devices.  Majority of those smart devices are Xiaomi smart devices. They are among the cheapest smart devices you can buy and they are actually very good! The bonus is that most of the them are also Homekit compatible either via their Xiaomi/Aqara Hub or Homebridge.  There are a lot of Homebridge plugins for Xiaomi smart devices. Homebridge-Miot is by far the most useful one for me. I have also installed "remootio 3" and "Bond-Bridge" which made my garage opener and ceiling fan controllable by Homekit via Homebridge-Remootio and Homebridge-Bond respectively. Lately I added "Xiaomi Gateway 3" which is a multi-mode gateway for Zigbee and Bluetooth/Bluetooth Mesh devices.  Although "Xiaomi Gateway 3" is said to be Homekit ready but regrettably the bluetooth/bluetooth mesh devices still do not appear on homekit citing that those bluetooth devices have yet to be approved by Homekit.  Fortunately Home assistant has a very popular plugin for "Xiaomi Gateway 3" which brings all devices, including the BLE devices, connected to the gateway to be available in Home Assistant and via HA Homekit Bridge, all devices, including the BLE devices, in HA are made available in Homekit.  As such, I introduced Home Assistant into my smart home ecosystem inoder to bring those BLE devices into homekit.  I have recently added Tuya compatible devices also, in particular Moes Smart Dimmer Switches, to my smart home ecosystem. This is because I could not get hold of any smart dimmer switches compatible with Xiaomi.  Through Home Assistant Tuya integration, I can also bring all those Tuya compatible devices into my Homekit.
- 🌱 I'm a self-taught ameteur in bash coding and since I retired in August 2021, I started doing some programming as a hobby and enjoyment.  I’m currently doing some self-learning to code in Python3 and JavaScript. 
- 💞️ I’m very keen and looking to collaborate on homebridge plugins which connects non-homekit accessaories to Homekit. I have so far thoroughly enjoyed the collaboration with @mitch7391 on Homebridge-cmd4-advantageair.
