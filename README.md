- 👋 Hi, I’m @uswong.  I am living in Perth, Australia.
- 👀 My home is now quite a smart home with more than 120 smart devices.  Majority of those smart devices are Xiaomi smart devices. They are amoung the cheapest smart devices you can buy and they are actually very good! The bonus is that most of the them are now also Homekit compatible either via their Xiaomi/Aqara Hub or Homebridge.  Homebridge-Miot is by far the most useful one. Homebrige-Mi-Hygrothermograph is also good for bluetooth based temperature and humidity sensors. I have also installed "remootio 3" and Bond-Bridge which made my garage opener and ceiling fan controllable by Homekit via Homebridge-Remootio and Homebridge-Bond respectively.
- 🌱 I’m currently doing some self-learning to code in Python3 and JavaScript. 
- 💞️ I’m very keen and looking to collaborate on homebridge plugins which connects non-homekit accessaories to Homekit.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can contact me by email: uswong@gmail.com
