- 👋 Hi, I’m @uswong.  I am in Perth, Australia.
- 👀 I’m interested in getting my home to be a smart home.  I am an Apple fan too.  I have installed >120 Xiaomi smart devices and some of the devices are not Homekit compatible. I have recently managed to find a device which made my garage opener smart and controllable by Homekit via homebridge.  I am currently also looking to get my ceiling fan into my Homekit too.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python3 and very keen in getting involve in developing some homebridge plugins.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on homebridge plugins which connects non-homekit accessaories into Homekit.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can contact me by email: uswong@gmail.com
