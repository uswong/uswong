- 👋 Hi, I’m @uswong.  I am living in Perth, Australia.
- 👀 My home is now quite a smart home with more than 120 smart devices.  Majority of those smart devices are Xiaomi smart devices. They are among the cheapest smart devices you can buy and they are actually very good! The bonus is that most of the them are now also Homekit compatible either via their Xiaomi/Aqara Hub or Homebridge.  Homebridge-Miot is by far the most useful one. I have also installed "remootio 3" and Bond-Bridge which made my garage opener and ceiling fan controllable by Homekit via Homebridge-Remootio and Homebridge-Bond respectively. Lately I added Xiaomi Gateway 3 which is also a dual gateway for both Zigbee and Bluetooth/Bluetooth Mesh devices.  Although Xiaomi Gateway 3 is said to be Homekit ready but regrettably currently the bluetooth/bluetooth mesh devices still do not appear on homekit citing that those bluetooth devices has not been approved by Homekit yet.  However, Home asistant has a very popular plugin for Xiaomi Gateway 3 which brings all devices connected to the gateway to be available in Home Assistant.  As such, I introduced Home Assistant into my smart home ecosystem inoder to bring those bluetooth devices into homekit.
- 🌱 I’m currently doing some self-learning to code in Python3 and JavaScript. 
- 💞️ I’m very keen and looking to collaborate on homebridge plugins which connects non-homekit accessaories to Homekit. I have so far thoroughly enjoyed the collaboration with @mitch7391 on Homebridge-cmd4-advantageair.
